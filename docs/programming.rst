The Piccolo software has two parts:

* Server
* Client

The server, *Piccolo Server*, runs on the Raspberry Pi that is part of the Piccolo. The client, *Piccolo Client*, can be run either on the Raspberry Pi or on a remote computer such as a laptop. If run on a remote computer there must be a network connection available to the Piccolo.
