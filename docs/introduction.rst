Introduction

The Piccolo is a hardware instrument for recording the optical spectrum of light. The hardware includes a spectrometer (or two spectrometers on the *Piccolo Doppio*) and an optical fibre. Light input to the instrument is controlled by electronic shutters and fore-optics provide a weather-proof housing.

The Piccolo also includes a small computer, the Raspberry Pi, which controls the Piccolo hardware and acquires spectra. The Piccolo software on the Raspberry Pi can record spectra. It also allows the Piccolo to be controlled remotely from a remote laptop (or desktop computer) over a network link.

.. Need to describe hardware also.
This documentation covers the essential features of the Piccolo software:

.. * Setting up the hardware
* Installing software on Piccolo
* Installing software on the laptop
.. * Testing the hardware
.. * Using the graphical user interface
* Programming the Piccolo with Python
